            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: `Step 1: The SN1 mechanism favors substrates that can form the most stable carbocations.\nStep 2: Compare the given alkyl halides: primary (Ethyl), secondary (Isopropyl), primary benzylic (Benzyl), and tertiary (tert-Butyl).\nStep 3: A tertiary carbocation is highly stable due to hyperconjugation and inductive effects (+I) from three methyl groups.\nStep 4: Therefore, tert-Butyl chloride undergoes substitution exclusively via the SN1 pathway due to steric hindrance preventing SN2 and high carbocation stability favoring SN1.`,
